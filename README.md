This is a roguelike project that follows the tutorial from: "https://old.reddit.com/r/roguelikedev/comments/o5x585/roguelikedev_does_the_complete_roguelike_tutorial/" 2021.
I'm using Godot, C# and my custom framework that works with entities and complements (and some systems). It's not a pure ECS system, but well, it works well and I used this framework on "https://cutre-studio.itch.io/gotta-get-out" and "https://cutre-studio.itch.io/turn-around".
The project follows the structure of the original tutorial but I'm peeking at "https://github.com/Bozar/GodotRoguelikeTutorial/wiki" because it uses Godot to.
